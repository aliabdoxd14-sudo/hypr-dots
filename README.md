Hyprland Dotfiles

These are my personal Hyprland dotfiles. They include configurations, keybinds, themes, scripts, and everything I use for my daily workflow on Arch Linux.

If you're here to explore, copy, or remix the setup, go ahead. Just make sure you know what you're doing, because these configs are tailored to my system and may behave differently on yours.

Features

Clean and minimal Hyprland setup

Waybar configuration

Custom scripts for workflow automation

Theming and transparency tweaks

Keybinds optimized for fast navigation

Optional extra packages included in the installer

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/aliabdoxd14-sudo/hypr-dots.git


Enter the directory:

cd hypr-dots


Run the installer:

./install.sh


Wait a little bit and you're done. The script will place all configs in your home directory and install the required packages.

Notes

You should back up your existing dotfiles before running the script.

Some parts of the config are written for Arch Linux specifically.

If something breaks, read the config files. They’re not that scary.

License

Use it, change it, break it, fix it… it's your system now.
