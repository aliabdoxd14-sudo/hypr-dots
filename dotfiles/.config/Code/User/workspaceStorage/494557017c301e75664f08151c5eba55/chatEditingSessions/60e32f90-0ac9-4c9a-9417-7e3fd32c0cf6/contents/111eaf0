# Minimal pacman.conf for the live environment and installed systems to use
# This file is intended to live inside the ISO's airootfs and be copied into
# installed systems by the installer. It enables a local file-backed repo
# named "hyprland_iso" which points to a directory on the ISO that will
# contain all required .pkg.tar.zst files and the repo db.
